# Harness CD Pipeline Sample

![Cover Image CD Pipeline](Images/harness_cover_image.png)

This sample repository shows how to use the [Harness Continuous Delivery Pipeline](https://harness.io/products/continuous-delivery) to deploy an Nginx image to Google Kubernetes Engine using YAML based pipeline creation.

## Getting Started

Use this README to get started with our sample pipeline repository for CD. This guide outlines the basics of getting started with the Harness CD and provides a full YAML to set up your pipeline. This sample doesnâ€™t include configuration options for in-depth steps and configuring the pipeline for other services, but only focuses on Kubernetes.


Setting up and running the pipeline will take about 30 minutes, and by the end, you can run an Nginx image on your cluster with Harness!

## Workflow

The workflow gives instructions on the steps you should take to get started with the sample pipeline. The steps are as follows:
